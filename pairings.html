                            <p>Curious about the best beer and food pairings? You're not alone. For centuries, if you asked
                                a restaurant server in any mid-range to upscale American eatery what drink to pair with a
                                certain dish, he'd bring over the sommelier and a wine bottle negotiation would ensue. But
                                in the last decade, there's been a paradigm shift: Beer has made it onto the menu as more
                                than an afterthought.</p>

                            <p>Here, a list of beer and food pairing menu ideas to help you plan your next dinner party (or
                                what to order on your next night out!).</p>

                    <h2> Tips for Creating Food and Beer Pairings</h2>
                    <p>Now that you have an idea of what pairs with what, let's explore more. If you want to take a deeper dive
                        and start creating your own food and beer pairing ideas, here's what to consider.</p>
                    <h3>Play with Complementary or Contrasting Flavors</h3>
                    <p>Some chefs and sommeliers attempt to find commonalities, pairing, say, a spicy Thai dish with a spicy
                        pale ale (could also be a fruit-fruit or chocolate-chocolate synchronization, etc.). The idea is
                        that there is a pleasant echo. Notes in one sip evoke flavors in past or future bites. The opposite
                        approach suggests that contrasting flavors are pleasing in a ying-yang sort of way: A dry, bitter
                        stout classically pairs with oysters, perhaps "cutting through" the sweetness of the shellfish. Sweet
                        and salty always work wonders. Remember that dominant food flavors can come from the protein (like
                        beef), the sauce (such as a cream sauce), or the method of preparation (grilling, for example).</p>
                    <h3>Beware of Simply Matching the Region</h3>
                    <p>Many people think if you're having Mexican food, it's a safe bet that a Mexican beer will pair well.
                        The truth is: Most restaurants offer only a small selection of beers and mostly because that's what
                        people are used to seeing on a menu. Mexican Tecate, Thai Singha, Indian Kingfisher, and Chinese
                        Tsingtao are all great European pilsner-style beers, but they're not universal pairing solutions
                        for all dishes from their respective countries. (Some of these brands are actually brewed in the
                        U.S. or Canada anyway.) Beer experts advocate stronger and fruitier flavors when dining on spicy
                        fare: ales, Hefeweizens, and wheat beers in particular. No matter what type of beer you choose, the
                        coldness will feel good against hot food.</p>
                    <h3>Drink What You Like</h3>
                    <p>If you love pale ale, you'll probably like it with anything you eat. And you know what? There's nothing
                        wrong with that. Experiment: There are no wrong answers.</p>
